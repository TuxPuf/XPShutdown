# XPShutdown
Windows XP-like Shutdown Menu
This is a .NET application which simulates the Windows XP Shutdown menu, with a grayed out desktop, window and customisable strings for easy translation.

The sleep option is disabled by default, as I found it doesn't really work with all computers. It can be enabled by adding a line in the optional translation / config file: "sleepon=1"
